<h1 align="center">Weather App</h1>
<p align="center">simple looking weather app; it shows the minimum necessary information about the current weather.</p>

---

I've tried multiple times to understand how to work with API datas, how to fetch, store and assing information to different DOM elements.
After studying and reading a lot, this is my first projects with API. And ofcourse, like every project, I tried to make it to look beautiful.

You can see the project live here: <a href="https://raulpop.ro/projects/weather/" target=_blank>Weather</a>

<h2>Updates?</h2>
There probably will be minor changes for this project. As I learn new things and get more confortable with coding, I'll probably change thinks around.
